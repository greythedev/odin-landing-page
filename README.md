# odin-landing-page

This is a simple static website project on designing a landing page using lessons and skills learned from the Odin Project.

This project was made using the tools below.

- Git
- Github
- VS Code

Doing this project helped me understand CSS in a deeper level. The practice of copying a page design from an image or an actual site is always an exciting and fun activity to do. After finishing copying the design and following the sizing, I added my own flair by changing up some elements in sizes in order to fit more to my own aesthetic values and taste.
